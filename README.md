This is a single header libray for a reliable UDP protocol, meant for games that require minimal latency.

I do not recommend using it yet, it has some unsolved issues and potentially bugs in it. Contributions or tips are welcome as long as they follow the general conventions of this library (single header and in "imperative" coding style).

Ideally I will make it compatiple with C99 after I consider it in an usuable state. Same for usage examples etc.
